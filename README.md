# SnapService
<br>
a roblox module.

SnapService is a module that helps you make in game screenshots and videos without needing to save it to the users device!

I created this becasue I saw people wanting to make a system like snapchat.

The recordings/screenshots do NOT support light (kinda), the sky, and terrain
